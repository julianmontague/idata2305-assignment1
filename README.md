# Assignment 1 

## Instructions
a.	A README.md with instructions to run your code

The code can be run by loading the code into you IDE and running the main method in the Main class.
The code can also be run by running the jar file in the root folder of the project. 
The jar file can be run by using the command "javac (path to file)/Main.java" in the terminal. 
The jar file can be found in the root folder of the project.
To switch between single and multithreaded, the user can change the value of the variable "singleThreaded" in the Main class.

When the file is run, the user can access it by opening up a browser and typing "localhost:8080" in the searchbar.


## Observations

b.	A section in your README.md or docs/REPORT.md documenting and explaining your observations.

The observations made from the code can be found was that when the code was run single threaded, 
it could only handle on request at a time. Therefore, if there were multiple users trying to access the server
at the same time, only the first user would be able to access the server.
When the code was run multithreaded, it could handle multiple requests at the same time. 
Therefore, all the users would be able to access the server at the same time.
